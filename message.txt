To address these issues, team collected hundreds of videos of the faces of heads locked in position while the animals were subjected to stimuli intended to induce particular emotions. These included tail shocks to induce pain, sucrose solution for pleasure, quinine solution for disgust, and injections of lithium chloride to cause malaise. The video data were then processed with machine learning algorithms, which led to the identification of six specific facial expressions in the mice associated with six specific emotions the four mentioned above plus two types of fear: one associated with freezing, the other with escape. These fear states were not specifically induced by the researchers but occurred spontaneously in some of the mice. The researchers published their findings today (April 2) in Science.
